## About The Project

**Xenon** is designed for developers who love dark interfaces but still want a splash of vibrant, carefully-selected color. It provides a high-contrast, low-distraction environment with a focus on readability and modern aesthetics. The syntax highlighting is based on familiar color schemes, remapped to fit the unique Xenon accent palette.

## Included Themes

This extension packs five distinct theme variations to match your preference:

-   **Xenon**: The signature theme with a balanced and modern feel.
-   **OneXenon**: A remap of the classic One Dark palette.
-   **Xenokai**: A remap of the beloved Monokai color scheme.
-   **Xenongit**: A remap inspired by the GitHub Dark theme.
-   **Xenozed**: A remap based on the Solarized Dark philosophy.
